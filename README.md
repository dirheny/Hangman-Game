# Hangman-Game
It's my first python mini project. In this project, firstly you have to choose an option of guess type i.e Boys, Girls or Mix of both. After doing this you have to guess a letter of the name of person. You have total seven chances and if you guess all correctly then you will win the game otherwise if you attempt seven wrong letters then you lose.
